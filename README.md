# VerstaTest

This is a test case that based on this ( https://versta24.ru/hr/testfordevjun ) task.
I'm planning to add some more features like autosuggestions while enter city or address and want to add CRUD operations for manage orders and I also want to have orders informations hided but order number in the future.

I use the PostgreSQL dbms, so to launch the project you should have PostgreSQL and create user "test" with password "test" OR just change connection strings in appsettings.json

In general there's no difficulties to launch the project.
